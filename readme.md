# Photo Importer #

This simple script is designed to help with importing photos from various sources into one directory with specific structure. 
It was created specifically to help with [Shotwell Photo Manager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell), cause I had trouble with importing photos from different directories in 0.22.0 version.

Script finds various dates in file, takes the oldest one and either moves or copies it to created directory structure.
